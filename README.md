# vscode-md-img-paster

A Visual Studio Code extension to quickly paste an image from the clipboard to a markdown file.

NOTE: This is created for my personal use, and it only works on **Mac OS**. I may add support for other platforms in the future.


## Usage

When you are editing a markdown file, you can use: `cmd + alt + V` to paste an image from the clipboard.
This extension will prompt you for a file name and save the image under the `images/` folder, and then import the image in the markdown file at your cursor.
