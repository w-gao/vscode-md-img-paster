# vscode-md-img-paster

A Visual Studio Code extension to quickly paste images from the clipboard to a markdown file.

NOTE: This is created for my personal use, and it only works on **Mac OS**. I may add support for other platforms in the future.


## Usage

- When you are editing a markdown file, you can use: `cmd + alt + V` to paste an image from the clipboard.
